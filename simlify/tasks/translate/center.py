    r"""Loads a molecular structure, centers it by its center of mass, and optionally
    saves the centered structure to a new file.

    This function orchestrates the process of reading a molecular structure
    using MDAnalysis, centering it using the
    [`center_structure`][simlify.structure.center.center_structure]
    function, and then writing the centered coordinates to a specified output file.

    Args:
        path_topo: The path to the topology file of the molecular system.
            Common file formats include PDB, GRO, and TPR.
        path_coords: The path to the coordinate file(s) of the molecular system.
            This can be a single file path (e.g., a trajectory file like TRR or XTC),
            a list of file paths, or `None` if the topology file already contains
            coordinate information (as is the case for some PDB files).
        path_output: The path to the output file where the centered structure
            will be saved. If this argument is `None`, the centered structure
            will not be written to a file. The file format is typically inferred
            from the file extension (e.g., `.pdb`, `.gro`).
        kwargs_universe: A dictionary of keyword arguments that will be passed
            to the [`load_mda`][simlify.structure.io.load_mda] function when
            creating the MDAnalysis Universe object. This allows for customization
            of how the structure is loaded (e.g., specifying atom names or residue
            numbers).
        kwargs_writer: A dictionary of keyword arguments that will be passed
            to the [`write_mda`][simlify.structure.io.write_mda] function when
            saving the centered structure. This can be used to control the output
            format or other writing options.
        overwrite: A boolean flag indicating whether to overwrite the output file
            if it already exists. If `True`, the existing file will be overwritten.
            If `False` and the file exists, an error might be raised depending
            on the `write_mda` function's behavior.

    Returns:
        The MDAnalysis Universe object representing the molecular system after
        it has been centered by its center of mass.

    Examples:
        Centering a PDB file and saving the result:

        ```python
        from simlify.structure.center import run_center_structure

        centered_universe = run_center_structure(
            path_topo="input.pdb",
            path_output="centered.pdb",
            overwrite=True,
        )
        print(f"Centered universe has {centered_universe.atoms.n_atoms} atoms.")
        ```

        Centering a topology and trajectory file without saving:

        ```python
        from simlify.structure.center import run_center_structure

        centered_universe = run_center_structure(
            path_topo="topol.gro",
            path_coords="traj.xtc",
        )
        print(
            f"Center of mass of the centered universe: {centered_universe.atoms.center_of_mass()}"
        )
        ```

        Passing additional arguments to the MDAnalysis Universe constructor:

        ```python
        from simlify.structure.center import run_center_structure

        centered_universe = run_center_structure(
            path_topo="protein.pdb",
            kwargs_universe={"atom_name_column": "name"},
            path_output="centered_protein.pdb",
        )
        ```
    """
    u = load_mda(path_topo, path_coords, **kwargs_universe)
    u = center_structure(u)

    if path_output:
        write_mda(u, u.atoms, path_output, overwrite=overwrite, **kwargs_writer)
    return u
