"""Module for optimizing the orientation of a molecular system to minimize its bounding box volume.

This module provides functions to rotate a set of atomic coordinates in 3D space
and to find the optimal rotation that results in the smallest possible bounding box
volume. It leverages the MDAnalysis library for reading molecular structures,
NumPy for numerical operations, SciPy for optimization and rotations, and loguru
for logging.

The core functionality includes:
- Rotating a set of atomic positions by specified Euler angles.
- Calculating the volume of the bounding box enclosing a set of positions.
- Using optimization algorithms to find the rotation angles that minimize this volume.
- A convenience function to load a PDB file, perform the optimization, and optionally
  save the rotated coordinates to a new PDB file.

This module is particularly useful for preparing molecular structures for simulations
or analyses where a compact representation or a specific orientation is desired.

    r"""Rotates a set of 3D Cartesian coordinates by applying Euler angles.

    This function takes an array of atomic positions and a vector of Euler angles
    (in degrees) and applies the corresponding rotation to the positions. The
    rotation is performed using the 'xyz' convention for Euler angles, meaning
    rotations are applied sequentially around the x, y, and z axes.

    Args:
        positions (npt.NDArray[np.float64]): A NumPy array of shape (N, 3) where N is the
            number of atoms, and each row represents the x, y, and z coordinates
            of an atom.
        rotation_v (npt.NDArray[np.float64]): A NumPy array of shape (3,) containing the

    This function takes a set of Euler angles and a set of atomic positions as input.
    It first rotates the positions using the provided angles and then calculates the
    volume of the smallest axis-aligned bounding box that encloses the rotated positions.
    This function is designed to be used with optimization algorithms to find the
    rotation that minimizes the bounding box volume.

    Notes:
        The bounding box volume is calculated using the `get_box_volume` function
        from the `simlify.structure.dims` module.

    This function takes the Cartesian coordinates of a system of particles and uses
    numerical optimization to find the Euler angles that, when applied to the system,

    is performed using the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function with the
    `volume_objective_f` as the objective function. The optimization is bounded to

    This function serves as a high-level interface to load a molecular structure from a PDB
    file, optimize its orientation to minimize the bounding box volume using the
    `minimize_box` function, and optionally save the rotated coordinates to a new PDB file.

    Args:
