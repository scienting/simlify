Dimensions of systems.

This module provides utility functions to calculate geometric properties
of a molecular system such as the bounding box lengths, box vectors,
and the volume of the box required to enclose the atoms.

def get_box_lengths(positions: npt.NDArray[np.float64]) -> npt.NDArray[np.float64]:
    r"""Compute lengths of box edges.

    This function calculates the lengths of the edges of a box that
    encompasses a set of atomic positions by finding the difference
    between the maximum and minimum coordinates in each dimension.

    Args:
        positions: A 2D NumPy array of shape (N, 3), where N is the
            number of atoms and each row represents the Cartesian coordinates
            [x, y, z] of an atom.

    Returns:
        A 1D NumPy array of shape (3,) containing the lengths of the
            box in the x, y, and z directions.

    Example:
        ```python
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from box_utils import get_box_lengths
        >>> positions = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 3]])

def get_box_vectors(positions: npt.NDArray[np.float64]) -> npt.NDArray[np.float64]:
    r"""Construct orthogonal box vectors.

    This function calculates the vectors of the edges of a box that
    encompasses a set of atomic positions. The vectors are represented
    as a diagonal matrix where the diagonal elements correspond to the
    lengths of the box edges.

    Args:
        positions: A 2D NumPy array of shape (N, 3), where N is the
            number of atoms and each row represents the Cartesian coordinates
            [x, y, z] of an atom.

    Returns:
        A 3x3 NumPy array representing the box vectors in matrix form.
            The matrix is diagonal since the box is assumed to be orthorhombic.

    Example:
        ```python
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from box_utils import get_box_vectors
        >>> positions = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 3]])

    Computes the volume of the orthorhombic box that encapsulates all atoms.
    The box vectors are assumed to form an orthogonal basis.

        positions: A 2D NumPy array of shape (N, 3), where N is the
            number of atoms and each row represents the Cartesian coordinates
