"""Module for modifying lines within PDB files, including functionalities for replacing
atom and residue names.

This module provides a set of utility functions to manipulate the content of Protein
Data Bank (PDB) files. It includes functions to perform general line modifications
based on filtering criteria, as well as specific functions for replacing atom names
and residue names within the ATOM and HETATM records of a PDB file. Additionally, it
offers a function to standardize the atom names of water molecules.

    r"""General function to modify specific lines in a PDB file based on filtering.

    This function iterates through a list of PDB lines and applies a processing function
    (`fn_process`) to lines that meet certain criteria defined by an optional filter
    function (`fn_filter`) and inclusion/exclusion lists.

    Args:
        pdb_lines: An iterable of strings, where each string represents a line
            from a PDB file.
        fn_process: A callable function that takes a PDB line as its first argument,
            followed by the elements of `fn_args`, and returns a modified PDB line.
            This function is responsible for the actual modification of the line.
        fn_args: An iterable containing additional arguments to be passed to the
            `fn_process` function after the PDB line itself.
        fn_filter: An optional callable function that takes
            a PDB line as input and returns a string. This string is then used to
            check against the `include` and `exclude` lists. If `None`, all ATOM and
            HETATM lines are processed.
        include: An optional list of strings. If `fn_filter` is provided,
            only lines for which the result of `fn_filter` is present in this list
            will be processed by `fn_process`.
        exclude: An optional list of strings. If `fn_filter` is provided,
            lines for which the result of `fn_filter` is present in this list
            will *not* be processed by `fn_process`. Defaults to `None`.

    Returns:
        A list of modified PDB lines. Lines that did not meet the filtering criteria
            or were not ATOM or HETATM records are returned unchanged.

    Notes:
        - The `fn_filter` function should be designed to extract a specific piece of information
          from the PDB line (e.g., residue name, atom name) that can be used for inclusion or
          exclusion.
        - If both `include` and `exclude` are provided and a filtered value is present in both,
          the line will be processed if it's in `include`. Exclusion takes precedence if only
          `exclude` is provided.

    Examples:
        To replace "CA" atom names with "CB" only in residues named "GLY":

        >>> pdb_lines = [
        ...     "ATOM      1  CA  GLY A   1       ...",
