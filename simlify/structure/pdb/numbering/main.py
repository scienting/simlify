    r"""Unifies the atom and residue numbering within a PDB file, ensuring sequential
    and consistent IDs.

    This function reads a PDB file and renumbers the atom serial numbers and residue IDs
    to be sequential, starting from 1 for the first atom and the first residue encountered.
    It also handles chain identifiers, incrementing them upon encountering a "TER" record
    if `reset_initial_resid` is True. Duplicate "TER" statements are removed, and "ENDMDL"
    records trigger a reset of atom and residue numbering, as well as the chain identifier.

    Args:
        pdb_path: The path to the input PDB file.
        output_path: The path to save the new PDB file with unified
            numbering. If `None`, no file is written, and the modified PDB lines are returned.
            Defaults to `None`.
        reset_initial_resid: If `True` (default), the residue numbering will
            start from 1 for the first residue in each chain. If `False`, the initial
            residue ID will be based on the original numbering in the PDB file for the
            first chain, and subsequent chains will continue sequentially.

    Returns:
        An iterable of strings, where each string is a line from the PDB file
            with the unified atom and residue numbering.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified `pdb_path` does not exist.
        IOError: If there is an error reading the PDB file or writing to the output file.

    Notes:
        -   The function iterates through the PDB lines, tracking the current residue
            and chain IDs.
        -   When a "TER" record is encountered, it signifies the end of a chain, and
            the chain ID is incremented if `reset_initial_resid` is True.
        -   "ENDMDL" records indicate the start of a new model, and all numbering is
            reset.
        -   Atom serial numbers are simply incremented sequentially.
        -   Residue IDs are unified within each chain, potentially resetting to 1 at
            the start of a new chain.

    Examples:
        To unify the numbering in "input.pdb" and save it to "output.pdb":

        >>> unified_lines = run_unify_numbering("input.pdb", output_path="output.pdb")

        To unify the numbering but keep the initial residue ID of the first chain:

        >>> unified_lines = run_unify_numbering(
        ...     "input.pdb", output_path="output.pdb", reset_initial_resid=False
        ... )

        To unify the numbering and only get the lines without saving to a file:

        >>> unified_lines = run_unify_numbering("input.pdb")
        >>> for line in unified_lines:
        ...     print(line.strip())
