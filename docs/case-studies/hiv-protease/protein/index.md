# Protein preparation

System preparation is a crucial step in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that significantly impacts the quality and reliability of results.
This process involves selecting an appropriate starting structure and setting up the system to accurately represent physiological conditions.
Proper preparation minimizes artifacts and ensures that simulations reflect the true behavior of the protein in its biological context.
