# HIV protease

This guide focuses on using Amber to simulate HIV-1 protease, a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a prime target for antiretroviral therapy.
The following sections will cover the practical aspects of using Amber for HIV-1 protease simulations, including system preparation, force field selection, simulation protocols, and data analysis techniques.
